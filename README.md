The purpose of this repository is to create a digital notebook where I can keep track of my created projects, what I learned, and useful resources.

## Overview
This backend development workspace will be my central hub for my application development: backend course.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout this course, my goals are to:
- Develop a strong understanding of backend development fundamentals
- Learn how to build and structure server-side applications
- Work with databases and understand how backend systems manage data
- Gain experience using APIs and handling client–server communication
- Improve my proficiency with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented backend code

## How I Plan to Use This Repo
I plan to use this repository to keep useful information throughout the course of the semester. In doing which I will keep a log of what I learned, important commands/ backend resources, and references.
